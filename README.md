# Vectrex-Vectorblade-PLCC-THT

PCB for VectorBlade with PLCC format memory on through-hole support.

I preferred to use a through-hole mount because it is more solid. And it has a hole on the bottom to eject the PLCC board easily without a puller.
The bracket is 8.1mm, which is only slightly more than the space between the PCB and the top of the plastic shell of the cartridge. I therefore recommend reducing the size of the bracket by removing the feet from the PLCC bracket.

This board is currently being tested and is not ready for production.
